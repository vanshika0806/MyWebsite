        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I'm a learning Web Developer skilled in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and Bootstrap. I recently started learning and have worked on a few projects like a Resume, Tinder for Dogs, Todo List etc. I also worked for a startup called Koik
          and helped in creating their Ventures page. I have a passion for working on projects and ideas that can make the world a better place.</p>

        <h3>Flutter Development</h3>
        <p>I found Flutter to be a very versatile tool to learn App Development and in my journey with Flutter I went on to make a few basic fun apps like a quiz app and a blog app. I look forward to learn more about Flutter and work on more engaging
          projects. </p>

        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>I'm really passionate about art and it is something that I love doing in my free time. I believe drawings and paintings or any form of art is a beautiful way to express yourself! </p>

        <h3>Guitar</h3>
        <p>Playing guitar is my hobby and way to tune out of reality for sometime. Also it's a great crowd pleaser and who doesn't love a good song?</p>
